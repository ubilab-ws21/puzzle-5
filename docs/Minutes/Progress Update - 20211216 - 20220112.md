# Summary of Progress

## HoloCube

Renamed HoloCubic to HoloCube for grammar.

### PCB

16/12: The PCB is expected to arrive in early January. There is no way to order new PCB due to limited time. Need a plan B in case the HoloCube cannot be made.

22/12: The main board is received. Extension board hasn't arrived yet.

10/1: Identified some problems with the circuit of the main board. Decided to reorder on our own on JCLPCB. Ideally the new boards will arrive by the end of next week. Software development should continue.

### Case

16/12: The case is 3D-printed

### Prism

The prism is arrived and planned to take it on 13/1 in the lab.

### Software

Able to establish BLE connection between the HoloCube and iPhone. Will proceed to establish connection with MCU.

Issue: [#29](https://github.com/ubilab-ws21/puzzle-5/issues/29)

Also working on SD card access in order to load images for the game. Currently able to load static image but GIF image is problematic.

Issue: [#39](https://github.com/ubilab-ws21/puzzle-5/issues/39)

MPU software development will wait until the completion of HoloCube main board because there is no working breakout board.

Issue: [#27](https://github.com/ubilab-ws21/puzzle-5/issues/27)

### 2048 Game Development

The game is realized. Control still rely on BLE serial commands.

[Issue #28](https://github.com/ubilab-ws21/puzzle-5/issues/28)

Fixing issue with loading gif from SD card.

Issue: [#3](https://github.com/ubilab-ws21/puzzle-5/issues/3)

## Charger Box / Electric Box's Battery Dock

16/12: Some drafts of signs for the charger box are made and posted in the escape room.

16/12: Suggested the radioactive warning sign of puzzle 4 to be placed on the charger box, which match the current setting of the box (nuclear battery charger box)

### NFC reader

Fedy:

17/12: NFC is tested working and the test code is pushed.

Terry:

11/1: Another NFC reader is tested working. Initial code containing basic NFC card reading and wifi connection for the battery dock is pushed to main.

### The Safe

Inspected the code from previous year. The code can be reused with a number of updates. Hardware is not necessary to change.

Issue: [#15](https://github.com/ubilab-ws21/puzzle-5/issues/15)

## MQTT Specification

Drafted a number of topics that the puzzle will need.

Issue: [#30](https://github.com/ubilab-ws21/puzzle-5/issues/30)

## Decoration

16/12: Mr. BÃ¶ttcher mentioned that where to place the electric box and how to decorate the environment around the box can be discussed later.

Lathif is in charge of the hardware decorations. He need to visit the escape room once again on 13/1 to learn more about the existing safe and the environment.

## Plan B

Come up with 2 plans in case the HoloCube hardware cannot be finished. One is to keep the 2048 game for unlock with another mean of control. Another one is to use the password lock on the safe for unlocking, with password hints from 2 NFC tagged batteries.
