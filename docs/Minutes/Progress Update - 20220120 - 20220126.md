# Summary of Progress

## HoloCube

### PCB

The re-ordered PCB is arrived, assembled and tested. MCU, WiFi, USB are working basically. However the IMU cannot be initialized. Fedy suspect either the library he's using is incompatible or the hardware connection is wrong.

Fedy will further test the IMU. If he can't make it work, he'll migrate the MPU6050 from Wang's breakout board to the PCB.

### Software

The game display is stabilized by not using WiFi and Bluetooth at the same time. This will only affect how the plan B should go so no impact at the moment.

The game can now display animated gif image.

## Charger Box / Electric Box's Battery Dock

### Assembly of charger box/ battery dock

The wire connection of the dock and the charger is finished. Need to sort out the wire in order to keep the MCU inside the box.

### Software Development

Both the charger and the dock can drive the LCD and the NFC reader. MQTT connections are established with support of UID and battery level data exchange.

The battery level display is also done.

### Decorations

Lathif proposed a design of the battery's cover.

Terry suggested that fluorescent tapes can be used to highlight the objects.

## MQTT Specification

Explained how puzzle 3 can subscribe our topic to monitor our game status.

Minor update to the payload. They should use raw byte as data.
