# Summary of Progress

## HoloCube

### PCB

Extension board is received. Fedy will assemble it after receiving the re-ordered main board

The re-ordered main board arrived German custom but is stuck. Clearance is expected to be done on Thursday 20/1.

### Prism

Received. It fits the 1.3" TTF LCD that Wang is holding.

### Software

Control with BLE is fully done. It should be an alternative mean of control for plan B.

MQTT for unlocking the safe is established. Will test the connectivity and functionality in the escape room on Thursday.

The display is found unstable when the MCU begins the WiFi connection. Inspection in progress.

## Charger Box / Electric Box's Battery Dock

### NFC

Able to detect specific UID of NFC tags.

The UID to be regarded as the battery is hard-coded in the ESP32 software. Update will be possible through MQTT.

### Battery Level Indicator

Successfully interfaced a LCD and a NFC reader together in an ESP32.

A preliminary indicator is designed and implemented.

### The Safe

Tutors prefer not to change the firmware of the safe box. Therefore, an independent charger (which consist of a ESP32, a NFC reader and a LCD, enclosed in a grey plastic box) will be placed into the safe instead.

The safe shall be unlock by the HoloCube through the old MQTT command.

## MQTT Specification

Refined the draft and added the proposed payload definitions.
